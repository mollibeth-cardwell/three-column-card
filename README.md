### Links

- Solution URL: [Three Column Card](https://mollibeth.dev/three-column-card)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap Grid and Flexbox
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)


### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice the Bootstrap CSS framework as well as custom CSS to render a website matching the design files as closely as possible. The Bootstrap grid system using rows and columns creates a fully responsive website using flexbox. I was able to implement the system to render the desktop and mobile view without writing media queries in my custom CSS file.


### Continued development

To improve this site, I would change the HTML to be more accessible for screen-readers. I'd like to look into how to use Bootstrap in conjunction with semantic HTML to clearly define meaning to each element.
